        <div class="info">
            <p>Groupers are <span class="first-sentence">teleosts</span> (ray-finned fishes), typically having a 
                stout body and a large mouth. They can be quite large, and lengths over a meter 
                and weights up to 100 kg are not uncommon, though obviously in such a large 
                group, species vary considerably. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces 
                off it. They do not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they 
                have heavy crushing tooth plates inside the pharynx. They habitually eat 
                fish, octopuses, and crustaceans. Reports of fatal attacks on humans by the 
                largest species, the giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) are unconfirmed.
            </p>

            <p>Their mouths and gills form a <span class="first-sentence">powerful</span> sucking system that sucks 
                their prey in from a <span class="first-sentence">distance</span>. They also use their mouths 
                to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out 
                through their gills. Their gill muscles are so powerful, it is nearly impossible 
                to pull them out of a cave if they feel attacked and extend those muscles to 
                lock themselves in.
