      <p>
        Groupers are <span class="first-sentence">teleosts</span> (ray-finned fishes), typically
        having a stout body and a large mouth. They can be quite large, and lengths over a meter and
        weights up to 100 kg are not uncommon, though obviously in such a large group, species vary
        considerably. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. They do not have many
        teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they have heavy crushing tooth plates inside the
        pharynx. They habitually eat fish, octopuses, and crustaceans. Reports of fatal attacks on
        humans by the largest species, the giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) are unconfirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their mouths and gills form a <span class="first-sentence">powerful</span> sucking system
        that sucks their prey in from a <span class="first-sentence">distance</span>. They also use
        their mouths to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through
        their gills. Their gill muscles are so powerful, it is nearly impossible to pull them out of
        a cave if they feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock themselves in.
